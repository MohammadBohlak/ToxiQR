    "description": "Every photo or observation you record of a snake whether found in the wild or near homes can greatly enhance our understanding of snake species and help determine their level of venomousness. Through our website, we analyze your sightings with precision to assess whether the snake is venomous, and we share this data with global biodiversity repositories to assist scientists and wildlife experts. A single photo from you could make a difference and help keep others safe."
